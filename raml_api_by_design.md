# RAML Apis By Design
By: Uri Sarid
[Raml Tools Website](http://raml.org/)

Just as a side note.... he is a lazy

"You want a layer cake of API's"

### Biggest anti patterns
* Don't expose your dirty laundry


### Api Success?
* Delight your users
* Design the api for your users
* Iterate Quickly
* Model cleanly and consistently <- make it easy damnit
* Engage

#### Design for your users
* API -> APX  as UI -> UX
Do that whole iteration pattern for UX design

#### Focus on the interface
* It is where your consumers touch
* It is how you want to be seen
* You should version more carefully than code
* Better interfaces -> better code
* Think about the organization
* The ultimate testing service

#### What kind of interface do we want
* Describe API's simple and clear
* Design API's easily and soundly
* Engage users in compelling ways

### Practically restful APis
* Nouns: Resouces, described by uri path
* Verbs: http methods
* MetaData: http headers
* Response: http status code
* Representations: appropriate media types in the body
* Hypermedia: HARD AS SHIT

### Documentation options out there
* WADL
* SWAGGER
* IODocs
* Google Discovery Docs
* Apiary Blueprint

### Yaml option?
* well know superset of json
* optimized for reading
* great for heiarchy
* cruft cut
* broad tooling based
* extensible-ish

### RAML
A new open spec for restful apis thats as cleans and structures as rest itself
It looks shiney OOOooooOOOOO


### What is next
* Open source tooling 
* Growing library of api specs in raml
* converters
* Client generators 
* Server Frameworks
* Testing Framework
* Mocking Services
* Evolve RAML Spec



### BEtter engagement for developers
* API Notebook
* * Allows you to go to an API notebook and mess around in an api based on the
  spec and engage in the API.  Pretty nifty IMO.... scratch that cool as SHIT
