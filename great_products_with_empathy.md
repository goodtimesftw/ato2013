# Building Great Products with Empathy
By: Jason Vanlue


### What to look for from two peeps perspective
#### User
1. What is the purpose of this page
2. What should I do on this page
3. Can I do this easily
4. Do I want to do this

#### You
1. What is the purpose of this page?
2. What is the primary user action
3. Is the action clearly understood
4. Is the design compelling


### How It should Work
* Discover
* Research
* Frame
* Style
* Construct
* Test
* Ship

Envy labs tries to bring designer and developer into the same meeting from
discovery to shipping? A lot more communication
